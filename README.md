# Case-Study-Cook-County-s-Housing

In this project, I embarked on an in-depth exploration of a comprehensive housing dataset situated within Cook County, Illinois, with a focus on understanding its intricate social context.

In Part A, I conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover the dataset's underlying structure. Additionally, I introduced new features to enhance the dataset's richness while meticulously cleansing the data.

Transitioning to Part B, I undertook the development and fitting of a specialized linear model for predictive purposes. Subsequently, I critically examined the model's predictive errors, leading to a collaborative session aimed at refining its performance.
